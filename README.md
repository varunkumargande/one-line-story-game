### Production URLs

**Frontend Webapp:** [one-line-story](https://one-line-story.monkwall.com/)

**Backend Production Endpoint:** [admin-one-line-story](https://admin-one-line-story.monkwall.com/stories)

**You can download envs:** [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mdzei_kbiZ_IItjyCbqoeEz063n0YOYg?usp=sharing)

### Backend Architecture (Node.js, Mongoose)

To initialize the backend with Node.js, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

To initialize the backend with Nodemon, execute:

```bash
npm run start
```

The backend codebase resides in the backend folder.

### Frontend Implementation (React.js)

To launch the frontend, utilize:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend codebase is organized within the frontend folder.

### API Documentation

A Link to access all my APIs via postman is [here](https://api.postman.com/collections/32817122-730e412b-b599-4dea-8b92-e6276af52901?access_key=PMAT-01HPD9D13AJVXG4A67FF3FZTZE).

### Utilized Tools

**Contentful:** A robust CMS solution.

**GitHub:** Centralized repository hosting.

**Vercel:** Seamless deployment and DevOps integration.

**MongoDB Atlas:** Reliable cloud-based database storage.

### This are not listed in Assigment but still I want to do

**Websockets Integration:**
Implemented in local for production need to use paid account of Vercel.

**Content Translation Framework:**
Enabling translation support for whole content. Asap 40% of data is translatable

**ChatGPT Interaction API:**
The API is prepared but pending integration. Need 1 more day. **Thats the reason as of now play with bot is same as multiplayer.**

**Import Order Optimization:**
Organizing import statements for improved code structure.

**Test Cases:**
Implementing Test Cases.

**Much More Mobile Responsiveness:**
80% is acheived but required some efforts to test in all devices.

**Note:**
This whole application is done in 16 hrs. So there is a scope for code improvement
