### Production URLs

**Frontend Webapp:** [one-line-story](https://one-line-story.monkwall.com/)

**Backend Production Endpoint:** [admin-one-line-story](https://admin-one-line-story.monkwall.com/stories)

### Backend Architecture (Node.js, Mongoose)

To initialize the backend with Node.js, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

To initialize the backend with Nodemon, execute:

```bash
npm run start
```

The backend codebase resides in the backend folder.

### Frontend Implementation (React.js)

To launch the frontend, utilize:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend codebase is organized within the frontend folder.
